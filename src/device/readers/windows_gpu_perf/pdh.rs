//! Performance Data Helper (PDH) sampling of the Windows GPU counter
//! families.
//!
//! Three counter families are read:
//!
//! | Counter | Shape | Gives us |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `\GPU Engine(*)\Utilization Percentage` | rate | device utilization |
//! | `\GPU Adapter Memory(*)\Dedicated Usage` | gauge | system-wide used VRAM |
//! | `\GPU Adapter Memory(*)\Shared Usage` | gauge | system-wide used shared memory |
//! | `\GPU Process Memory(*)\Dedicated Usage` | gauge | per-process VRAM |
//! | `\GPU Process Memory(*)\Shared Usage` | gauge | per-process shared memory |
//!
//! Both `Shared Usage` families exist because an integrated GPU reports a
//! flat 0 for every `Dedicated Usage` instance — nothing is allocated out
//! of its small stolen carve-out, and the real consumption sits in the
//! shared aperture. Sampling only the dedicated counters made all-smi
//! report `used_memory: 0` for every Intel and AMD iGPU on Windows.
//!
//! This is the same data Task Manager's GPU pane shows, and it is
//! vendor-neutral: AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA adapters all publish it
//! through WDDM.
//!
//! ## Why the query is persistent
//!
//! `Utilization Percentage` is a rate counter. A single
//! `PdhCollectQueryData` call establishes a baseline and yields no
//! usable value; the rate only exists once there are two samples to
//! difference. Rather than sleeping inside the reader to manufacture a
//! second sample, the query is opened once and kept alive in a process
//! global, and each all-smi poll contributes one collection. The first
//! poll after start-up reports no utilization, and every poll after that
//! reports the rate over the real poll interval. That matches how
//! all-smi already drives its other rate-like sources and keeps
//! `get_gpu_info` non-blocking.
//!
//! The two memory counters are gauges and are valid from the very first
//! collection, so they are returned immediately.
//!
//! ## Locale
//!
//! Counters are added with `PdhAddEnglishCounterW`, not
//! `PdhAddCounterW`. Counter path components are localized on non-English
//! Windows installations, so the literal English path only resolves
//! through the English-specific entry point.
